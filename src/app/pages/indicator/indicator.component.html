            First, either upload a single MS Word document here (.doc or .docx).
            You can use your grant or project funding application file for this purpose.
            <br/><br/>
            You can also start without a file upload and just access the entire database of indicators.
            <br/><br/>
            You can select the sector(s) that best apply to the subject of your project to limit the results.
            You may select as many sectors as you want.
            <br/><br/>
            Note: If you are unsure which sectors are relevant, don't worry –
            you'll be able to add more filters in the next step.

          <p>
            If you uploaded a document, here you will see the results statements (Impact, Outcome and Outputs) of your project. We are using machine learning to identify them, so there might be some mistakes.
            <br/><br/>
            On the right side of the table you can see the quality of the results statement. The higher the score, the better ,the colours are there to help you see the quality.
            <br/><br/>
            You can do 4 actions here, you can add new indicators through the purple "+" button, that is always at the end of the list. There you can chose the level and write the text.
            <br/><br/>
            You can always adjust change your results statement to improve it (or if our model did not find it adequately), and then the second button (with the tick in green), allows you to run the model again to check the quality of the statement. You can do this as many times as you want.
            <br/><br/>
            The red "x" deletes a results statement, be careful, we do not ask for confirmation.
            <br/><br/>
            Once you are satisfied with your results statements, you can click next. Whatever is now in this table will be moved to the visualisation and the final download automatically.
            <br/><br/>
            Should you not want to use this function, you can delete all statements and move on.

        <div class="step2Info" *ngIf="current == 2">

          <p>
            Here are the suggested indicators for you, based on the keywords in your
            document and the sectors selected. Indicators are categorised as Impacts,
            Outcomes, or Outputs. If you have not uploaded a document, we are showing
            you all indicators that matched your filter criteria.
            <br/><br/>
            Select the indicators you want to use to track the success of your project,
            then click Next.
            <br/><br/>
            Note: In this step, you can select additional sectors or indicators
            that you wish to include in your logframe.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step2Info" *ngIf="current == 3">
          <p><strong>Step 4<i nz-icon nzType="close" (click)="clickClose()" class="closeHelpIcon"></i></strong></p>
          <p>
            In this step you are able to view the success indicators in a visualization
            format. These indicators are derived from the selection you did in previous          
            step (Step 2) which are categorized into 3 levels – Impacts, Outcomes or          
            Outputs.
            <br/><br/>
            You can connect the shapes by dragging the ports. The ports will be hidden once shapes
            are connected and will only be visible of you disconnect again. You can also          
            delete the connectors and/or shapes by simply selecting them and use your          
            delete button from your keyboard.
            <br/><br/>
            If the shapes are located at a distance and you would like to connect the ports
            then you first have to click on the port and then drag the connector to the end          
            shape.
            <br/><br/>
            If by any chance you accidently delete a shape there is a easy option to undo and 
            redo. If you want to maximize the visualization please use zoom button.
            <br/><br/>
            Note: If you remove a shape from this visualization this will also remove the indicator
            which you had selected in Step #2.
