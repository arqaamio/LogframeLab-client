# Logframe Lab

Logframe Lab is an open source web application created to help NGOs and community-based organisations match their project ideas with the most relevant metrics for tracking their success. This tool leads you step-by-step through a simple process that results in a formatted, logical framework (logframe) that you can download and use for reporting your progress to your funders.
